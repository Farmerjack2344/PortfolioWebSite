            <p>
              This project investigates the suitability of geothermal energy for electricity generation in the UK,
              specifically evaluating the geothermal reservoir in Cornwall. Three different power cycles were
              modelled: a single flash cycle, a binary organic Rankine cycle (ORC), and a hybrid flash-binary cycle.
              The models were developed in MATLAB and validated using case studies from real geothermal plants.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              The goal was to determine which cycle performs best in terms of energy output and thermal efficiency,
              using CoolProp to source accurate thermodynamic properties of various working fluids.

            <p>
              Each cycle is a variation of the Rankine cycle, which includes processes like isentropic expansion
              in turbines and isobaric heat exchange. The binary cycle uses organic working fluids like n-pentane
              or R245fa, which allow operation at lower geothermal temperatures.

            <p class="mt-4">
              In the hybrid cycle, exhaust steam from the flash turbine is used to preheat the binary cycle fluid
              through a recuperator, improving overall efficiency. This method allows greater energy extraction
              from the geofluid before re-injection.

            <p>
              Cornwall has elevated geothermal gradients due to heat-producing granites. The UDDGP in Redruth
              targets reservoir temperatures of 150–200°C at depths of 5–7 km. Models were built around technical
              parameters of this site, including a geofluid temperature of 175°C at the production well.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4">
              The working fluid R218 was initially considered due to local plans, but n-pentane and cyclopentane
              outperformed it in terms of both work output and thermal efficiency.

              Produced a peak of ~350 kW at a pressure drop of 32%. However, it required high geofluid
              temperatures and flow rates, making it unsuitable for Cornwall's relatively moderate conditions.

              Reached 1.8–2 MW using R218, with the best performance at low injection well temperatures and
              high turbine inlet pressures. n-pentane and cyclopentane provided even better efficiency.

            <p>
              Higher efficiency is critical for sustainability — hybrid cycles allow better long-term resource
              use, delaying temperature drawdown in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) like Cornwall's.

            <p>
              The hybrid flash-binary cycle is the most suitable configuration for geothermal power generation
              in the UK based on performance, efficiency, and adaptability. While more complex, its greater energy
              output and efficient heat recovery make it a better long-term investment, especially in Enhanced
              Geothermal Systems like UDDGP.

              Future improvements could include the use of optimization algorithms and development of a user
              interface for broader usability by engineers and researchers.
