                <b>Mechanical Engineering MSc | Robotics & Sustainable Energy</b>.<br>
                <br>


                <br>
                My interests lie at the intersection of mechanical engineering and partially software development.
                Through both my coursework and personal projects, I’ve explored electronics and robotics—working with Arduino
                and programming microcontrollers as part of embedded systems modules. I've also had hands-on experience
                using the Elisa Robot platform, which deepened my understanding of hardware applications and sensor integration.
                <br>
                <br>
                I aspire to become a mechanical design engineer in the energy sector, with a focus on power plant design and system modelling.
                However, I am excited to contribute in any way I can.
                I’m particularly interested in the utilities industry and how we can create efficient, innovative solutions for energy generation.
                <br>

                As part of my <a href="{% url 'pfu:powerfromunderground' %}">final year</a> project, I designed and modelled a power cycle for a geothermal power plant based in the UK.
                I used MATLAB to simulate different power cycles and conducted a comparative analysis to identify the most efficient option.
                This project has solidified my enthusiasm for thermodynamics, modelling, and sustainable engineering design.

                <h2 class="display-6">Key Skills</h2>
                <p class="lead">In this paragraph I would like to highlight some of the skills that I have picked up in the <br>
                    pursuit of being a Mechanical Engineer with Robotics:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Python</b> to a high level of understanding, which I consider to mean understanding to use<br>
                            python code in a procedural, object-oriented and functional manner</li>
                        <br>
                        <br>


                        <li><b>C/C++</b> I learnt this so that I could more effectively programme an Arduino and because<br>
                            it is a very industry standard programming language.</li>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>MATLAB</b> and Simulink</li>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>SolidWorks</b></li>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Mechanical design and Simulation</b></li>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Advanced Mathematics</b></li>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Curiosity and research</b></li>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Information Technology</b> namely network virtualization and penetration</li>

                    </ul>
                    I decided to learn each of these skills as I believe to be a good engineer you need to continually learn as <br>
                    more technology comes out.
