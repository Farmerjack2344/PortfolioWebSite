                Welcome, to my portfolio/website I created with Django to represent myself.<br>
                My name is Nathaniel and I am an aspiring <b>Design Engineer</b>.<br>
                <br>

                I am currently Enrolled in Bachelors Degree studying Mechanical Engineering with Robotics<br>
                and so far it is going great, and I am excited for my future.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am interesting Mechanical Engineering and Software Development. <br>
                These interests have been fostered through electronics and robotics. I have experimented with Arduino<br>
                in my spare time and for my university course. Also, I have used an Elisa Robot as apart from my embedded<br>
                systems course so, I am familiar with hardware applications such as microchip programming.

                <br>
                <br>
                I would like to be a mechanical design engineer working in the energy sector. I want to work in the utilities
                sector working in power plant or the design of them. I equally interested in modelling systems as, I have come to
                enjoy creating them from my 3<sup>rd</sup> year project.
                <br>
                <br>
                For my 3<sup>rd</sup> year project, I decided the design a power cycle for a geothermal power plant within
                the UK and then model this power cycle using MATLAB. For this project I designed multiple power cycles
                and simulate them to decide which would be best.

                <h2 class="display-6">Key Skills</h2>
                <p class="lead">In this paragraph I would like to highlight some of the skills that I have picked up in the <br>
                    pursuit of being a Mechanical Engineer with Robotics:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Python</b> to a high level of understanding, which I consider to mean understanding to use<br>
                            python code in a procedural, object-oriented and functional manner</li>
                        <li><b>C/C++</b> I learnt this so that I could more effectively programme an Arduino and because<br>
                            it is a very industry standard programming language.</li>
                        <li><b>MATLAB</b> and Simulink</li>
                        <li><b>Mechanical design and Simulation</b></li>
                        <li><b>Advanced Mathematics</b></li>
                        <li><b>Curiosity and research</b></li>
                        <li><b>Information Technology</b> namely network virtualization and penetration</li>

                    </ul>
                    I decided to learn each of these skills as I believe to be a good engineer you need to continually learn as <br>
                    more technology comes out.
