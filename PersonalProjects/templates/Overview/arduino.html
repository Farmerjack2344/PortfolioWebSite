        <h2 class="display-5">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The aim of this project was to interact with an LCD screen through my Arduino Uno board using the Python Language.
            The motivation behind this project was that I wanted to bridge the Gap between my lack of practical mechanical engineering
            skills with practical coding technical experience. This project was especally helpful because it required me to
            look at the datasheet of the LCD screen that  had to map the Bniary codes to the signals that  would be sending to the
            LCD Screen. I also needed to fnd out whch pin did what.

            Ultimatley because the datasheet was in chinese I could quite understand what signals I would have to send
            to get characters that I wanted.

            To overcome this issue I created and exhaustive function that went through every binary code and sent it to
            the LCD Screen. Then when it came up I would type in the character that I saw. The function would then record
            these values to a text file that I would further turn nto a Python dictionary later

        <h2 class="display-5">Technical</h2>
        <p>
            In terms of the technical things that I learnt.
            First I learnt that what I was acttually doing was embedded systtems programming. I had to send data to the
            LCD screen telling it whether that signal I was sending it were <em>Data</em> or <em>Instructions</em>.

            Whenever I sentt data to the LCD screen I had to send a bit to the Data/instructioin register to tell it how
            to interpret the data had sent to it. Finding out what bytes meant what instructioins was made easier by the data
            sheet but the data I had to fnd on my own.

            Futhermore the LCD screen could take data in a 4 bit form where I send data 4bits at a time or an 8 bit form
            where I could just send whole bytes at a time.

            Some of the code that I made can be found on my GitHub
