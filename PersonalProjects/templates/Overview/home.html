                <p class="lead">
                Welcome, to my portfolio/website I created with Django to represent myself.<br>
                My name is Nathaniel and I am an aspiring <b>Design Engineer</b>.<br>
                <br>

                I am currently Enrolled in Bachelors Degree studying Mechanical Engineering with Robotics<br>
                and so far it is going great and I am excited for my future.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am interesting Mechanical Engineering and Software Development. <br>
                These interests have been fostered through electronics and robotics. I have experiemented with Arduino<br>
                in my spare time and for my university course. Also, I have used an Elisa Robot as apart of my embedded<br>
                systems course so, I am familiar with hardware applications such as microschip programming.

                <br>
                <br>
                I would like to be an design engineer working in the energy sector. I currently want to work with/ design systems
                within power plants and sustainable energy solutions. Mostly hydro electric and nuclear power plants.

                I deeply enjoy physics hence why I picked the degree that I did. However I thought there were fields <br>
                that were off limits to me now that I had picked mechanical engineering. Nuclear physics being one of them.<br>
                Upon investigation I found that there were more mechanical systems involved than I thought.<br>
                such as:
                <ul>

                    <li>Turbines</li>
                    <li>Pressurized Water Reactors</li>
                    <li>Boiling Water Reactors</li>
                    <li>FeedWater Systems</li>

                </ul>
                To name a few. With this in mind I would love to keep learning about these subbbjects in the practical sense<br>
                as I believe I have learnt enough theoretically to truly a appreciate the practical.
                <br>
                <br>

                </p>

                <h2 class="display-6">Skills</h2>
                <p class="lead">In this paragraph I would like to highlight some of the skills that I have picked up in the <br>
                    pursuit of being a Mechanical Engineer with Robotics:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Python</b> to a high level of understanding, which I consider to mean understanding to use<br>
                            python code in a procedural, object oriented and functional manner</li>
                        <li><b>C/C++</b> I learnt this so that I could more effectively programme an Arduino and because<br>
                            it is a very industry standard programming language.</li>
                        <li><b>MATLAB</b> and Simulink</li>
                        <li><b>Advanced Mathematics</b></li>
                        <li><b>Curiosity and research</b></li>
                        <li><b>Information Technology</b> namely network virtualisation and penetration</li>

                    </ul>
                    I decided to learn each of these skills as I belive to be a good engineer you need to continually learn as <br>
                    more technology comes out.

                    <p class="lead end">I like to play a miriad of games some of which spark my inspiration for what I do<br>
                                    in my professional life. <br>
                                    Some of which include:
